It is realy sad to read such poor tendentious story about Lviv. Its author Andres Wysling seemed to be tired/blinded from cheap vodka while writing it -maybe traumatised by his own personal inability to find any suitable accomodation anywhere in the world in the age of internet .
I would like to know his measure for a "rich town", because I find Zuerich much more poorer compared to Lviv, if the measure is history and its monuments.
I recommend you to .
