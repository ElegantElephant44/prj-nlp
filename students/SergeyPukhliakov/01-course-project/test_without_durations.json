Matt Williams, Dev Evangelist at\nDatadog, will go through Step Functions via AWS Lambda. Jason Carter, software\ndev at Simplisafe, will walk us through visualizing and organizing our\ndependencies.

It may even be useful (and not\njust a thumbnail generator). But an application is more than a single\nfunction; you need a lot of them. How do you get your functions working\ntogether? In this short introduction I\u2019ll get you started with Step Functions\nand show you how easy it is to use them to orchestrate AWS Lambda.  \n  \nMatt Williams is one of the Evangelists at Datadog and an organizer of DevOps\nDays Boston. He is passionate about the power of monitoring and metrics to\nmake large-scale systems stable and manageable. So he tours the country\nspeaking and writing about monitoring with Datadog. When he's not on the road,\nhe's coding.  \n\u2014\u2014  \n  \nQuick break ~7:30pm - 7:45pm  \n\u2014\u2014  \n  \nTalk #2: Dependency Graphing: Visualize to organize with Jason Carter\n(@WakeStudio (https://twitter.com/WakeStudio))  \n  \nJason is a software developer at SimpliSafe working on the recently launched\nSimpliSafe v3 Home Security System. Works on the backend web services in\nNodeJS. Previously worked at Layer3 TV which was recently acquired by TMobile.  \n\u2014\u2014  \n  \nTalk #3: React + Storybook + Markdown. SAY WHAT?!?!?! with Andric LibreSinn (\nhttps://github.com/mrpotatoes )  \n  \nStorybook is great for creating React based components but there are some\ndrawbacks. In this discussion we will present a small library that allows us\nto efficiently build a storybook entry for a component and keep it\u2019s\ndocumentation up to date at the same time!  \n  \nAndric is a software engineer working at Liberty Mutual. He rocks the backend\nand the front end (but prefers a mix of both) and does so in JavaScript (which\nis his new jam and I doesn\u2019t think he will ever leave it).
