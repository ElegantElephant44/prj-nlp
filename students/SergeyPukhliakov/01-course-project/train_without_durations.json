            "payload": "Many Power Deals Announced By Calif Gov Still Not Final\nBy Jason Leopold\n  \n03/07/2001 \nDow Jones Energy Service \n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) \nOF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n   \n(This article was originally published Tuesday.)\nLOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Many of the long-term power supply contracts \nannounced by California Gov. Gray Davis this week remain under negotiation or \nare the subject of ongoing lawsuits, power suppliers said Tuesday. \nThe lack of finality to the deals raises questions about the state's success \nin covering its power needs, particularly going into what is expected to be \nan unusually tight summer. \nGenerators said privately they were surprised the governor went ahead with \nhis announcement Monday, given that many of the contracts haven't been signed.\nDavid Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and \nPower, who negotiated the contracts on behalf of the state, conceded that \ndetails remain to be worked out. \n\"This is not a done deal,\" Freeman said, adding that credit concerns are \nkeeping generators from signing the deals. \nDavis announced Monday that California has secured 40 long-term contracts \nthat will provide California with about 629 million megawatt-hours of \nelectricity over 10 years, at a price of more than $40 billion. \nSeveral of those forward deals, however, involve contracts originally held by \nEdison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp. \n(PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric at the California Power Exchange, \npreviously the state's main power market. \nThe governor seized those contracts earlier this year, just before the Power \nExchange liquidated them to cover hundreds of millions of dollars in power \nbills the utilities had failed to pay. \nThe contracts, which total about 1.3 million megawatt-hours of electricity \nand have a market value of about $1 billion, according to market sources, \nhave yet to be paid for or signed over to the state. Duke Energy (DUK), one \nof the suppliers that sold the contracts to Pacific Gas & Electric and \nSouthern California Edison, has sued Davis for unlawfully commandeering those \ncontracts. \nAlthough Duke has reached an interim settlement to continue providing power \nto the state Department of Water Resources until April 30, the company and \nthe Davis administration still have to \"develop a comprehensive long-term \nsettlement to pay for the power supply contracts,\" said Duke spokesman Tom \nWilliams. \nThe governor went ahead with the announcement, because the California \nDepartment of Water Resources believes it will be able to finalize and sign \nthe contracts over the next several weeks, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio \nsaid. \nSeparately, several suppliers named in the governor's announcement Monday - \nincluding Duke, Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), Mirant Corp. (MIR), Sempra Energy \n(SRE), Enron Corp. (ENE) and Avista Corp. (AVA) - said they have yet to sign \nfinal agreements with the state, although negotiations were ongoing. \n\"We are working in good faith with the DWR toward a long-term contract,\" said \nArt Larson, spokesman for Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra Energy \n(SRE). Larson said Sempra signed a terms of agreement with the DWR and \nexpects to reach a final agreement over the next several weeks. \nReliant Energy said it has only signed a short-term contract with the state \nthat expires in about two weeks. The company will only sign a long-term \ncontract once it's paid more than $400 million owed by Pacific Gas & Electric \nand Southern California Edison, spokesman Richard Wheatley said. \nMirant Corp. said it also won't sign contracts with the state until it's \npaid. \nEnron said it's reached agreement on terms with the state, but has some \ncredit-related details to hammer out. \n\"Everything's been agreed to except for some credit technicalities,\" Enron \nspokesman Mark Palmer said. \n-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; \njason.leopold@dowjones.com\n \n  \nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

            "payload": "SIVY ON STOCKS from money.com\nMay 7, 2001\nHigher Flyer\nTop techs such as Nokia may not look cheap by traditional valuation\nmeasures. But they may still be good buys.\nBy Michael Sivy\nValue is a relative term. Every once in a while, you get a chance to buy\nshares in a company with annual earnings growth of more than 20 percent at\na price/earnings ratio of 16 or less. But that doesn't happen very often.\nMost of the time, conservative investors are lucky to find 14 percent\ngrowth at a 16 P/E. Slightly more aggressive investors might be happy with\n18 percent growers at P/Es in the low 20s. The most successful growth\nstocks, however, may never fall all the way down to those cheap valuations.\nBut that doesn't mean you shouldn't buy them.\nIn fact, there are good reasons to devote at least a part of your portfolio\nto those kinds of high flyers. For one thing, those companies are typically\namong the world's most successful. In addition, they receive ongoing\nsupport and sponsorship from Wall Street analysts. As long as they continue\nto meet expectations, they will hold up fairly well in temporary market\ndownturns. And they will be among the first stocks to bounce back.\nA perfect case in point looks to be Nokia [NOK]. The Finnish giant is the\nmost successful firm in one of the world's most rapidly growing industries.\nAnd since 1997, Nokia's share of the global wireless-phone handset market\nhas risen from less than 20 percent to 35 percent, helping the company\nnearly double earnings per share since 1998.\nOf course, no company can increase its market share indefinitely, but there\nare several factors that should help sustain Nokia's superior profit\ngrowth. Since most everyone who would use a cell phone already has one, the\nbulk of the sales of cell phones using existing technology is replacement\nbusiness. And when existing users switch phones, they tend to maintain\nbrand loyalty -- if they change providers at all, they migrate toward the\nstrongest one (say from Ericsson to Nokia, but not the other way around).\nAs a result, Nokia could gain another couple of market share points in\ncurrent-technology handsets.\nEven more important, the company is capable of attaining a market share\ntopping 40 percent in the next generation of handsets -- both those that\nuse more sophisticated technology for voice transmission and those that\nwill provide paging, instant messaging, and Internet access. Overall, the\nhandset market is projected to grow at an annual compound rate of just\nunder 23 percent over the next four years. And with market share gains,\nNokia's sales should do even better.\nIn the past few quarters, the over-capacity problems that have plagued the\ntelecom industry have been hurting handset makers as well as service\nproviders. Not only has growth slowed -- total sales of cell phones were up\nonly 12 percent in the first quarter -- but the introduction of new\ntechnology is being delayed. As a result, Nokia's earnings, up just 15\npercent in the first quarter, will likely fall short of a 20 percent gain\nfor the year as a whole.\nOnce the current slump passes, however, Nokia's growth should recover to\nnearly 25 percent a year. And so, despite a P/E of 40 based on estimated\nearnings for the current year, the stock seems quite attractive. At $33,\nNokia is trading at just over half the level it was a year ago. And the\nshare price, which dipped as low as $21 a month ago, now appears to be in\nan upswing. Even if the next couple of quarters show subpar results, Nokia\nfigures to be back among the market's brightest stars within 12 months.\n###\nPost your comments on Michael's column at:\nhttp://www.money.com/depts/investing/sivy/index.html\nTo subscribe or unsubscribe to Sivy on Stocks, go to:\nhttp://www.money.com/email/\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nMARKETPLACE\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nCONTACT THE BIGGEST COMPANIES IN THE WORLD!\nOver 5,000 contact names in the OFFICIAL FORTUNE Databases.\nDOWNLOAD THEM NOW!\nhttp://www.fortune.com/datastore/?mn1\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\nSpecial Internet Offer!!!\nSign up for a RISK-FREE issue of MONEY MAGAZINE at\nhttp://www.money.com/subscribe2\nOr if you prefer call our toll-free number 1-800-544-4594\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\nWe may, from time to time, contact you with offers for Time Inc.\nproducts and services which we think may be of interest to you.\nIf you would prefer us not to contact you in this manner, AND\nYOU DID NOT INDICATE THIS PREFERENCE AT THE TIME YOU SIGNED UP\nfor the Sivy on Stocks online newsletter or any other Time Inc.\nonline newsletters, please let us know by sending us an e-mail\nat <no_solicit@money.com>.\nAdditionally, from time to time we may provide your e-mail\naddress to carefully chosen companies whose offers we think may\nbe of interest to you.

Jeff will also retain his duties as president and chief operating officer.  I will continue as chairman of the Board and will remain at Enron, working with Jeff on the strategic direction of the company and our day-to-day global operations.\nJeff will assume the role at a time when the company is hitting on all cylinders and is positioned for phenomenal growth.  He is clearly ready for the job, and after 15 years as CEO of this great company, I=01,m ready for a somewhat different role.\nOur succession plan has been clear for some time.  This has afforded Jeff and me the freedom to combine our strengths toward building a company that continues to exceed everyone=01,s expectations, including our own.  We look forward to furthering that relationship as Jeff expands his role.\nThere are no plans for any other changes in our management team nor broad shifts in strategy and direction.\nPlease join me in congratulating Jeff.  I look forward to a great 2001."

We were also\nsuccessful in communicating our cost-benefit analysis and delaying the\nimmediate adoption of the team. The motion (approved 5-0) read:\nBoard of Governors Market Repair Team\nMOVED, that the Board approve the concept of a Market Repair Team along the\nlines described in the Florio memorandum of March 14, 2001, and directs ISO\nmanagement to provide a response to the proposal addressing among other\nissues, issues of cost/ benefit, conflicts of interest, team composition at\nthe next Board meeting.\nIEP, CMUA, SMUD, and Grid Services were all asked to submit some proposed\nnames by today to the ISO Management, please see below e-mail from Elaina:\nToday during the Public Comment, you all indicated that you might have names\nas potential members of the Advisory Group for the Market Repair Team.  It\nis not clear at this point how the whole process will be structured, but we\nhave been asked to put together a proposed game plan including names for\npotential members of the Advisory Group.  Please send them to me ask quickly\nas you can:  Friday pm is what Chairman Kahn asked for.\nWe would like to be as responsive as possible to the request and have\nthought of the idea of proposing someone that EPSA uses in a variety of\nroles.  CMUA will also probably be proposing someone from their national\norganization.  The name that has been suggested for IEP to submit is Craig\nRoach of Boston Pacific consulting who has done extensive work for EPSA in\nsupporting a competitive market policy. There is more information on Dr.\nRoach and Boston Consulting on their web site www.bostonpacific.com.  I\nspoke with Julie Simon at EPSA this morning and she also gave him an\nenthusiastic endorsement.\nAnother idea or an additional person to submit  would be an economist that\nis involved heavily in California.  Since both Hogan and Joskow have\nfinancial ties to market participants we may want to consider proposing our\nown economist.  It is the plan to submit both names to the ISO as well as a\nletter addressing the following:\n1. Raise very gently the issue of potential conflict of interest, coupled\nwith cost/benefit analysis etc\n2. Address structural issues, including how stakeholders will participate.\n3. Propose more diversity for the Market Repair Team,\n4.

Members of the Transaction Development team have a strong track record of closing structured transactions involving both capital and commodity risks.  Sample deals would include working on the acquisition of Garden State Paper earlier this year, and structuring and pitching the first all requirements, index based, physical steel supply contract to one of the largest players in the steel servicing segment of the steel industry.\nThe ability to buy and sell physical product will be critical to creating a commodity product in these businesses.  Getting access to the physical product will require creating compelling financing structures, as well as potentially buying assets to get control of their production capability.  In all these situations, the Transaction Development team will be a key player in driving these opportunities to closure.\nPEP - REVIEWER FEEDBACK DEADLINE\nThe Year End 2000 Performance Review Process closes November 17.

If you disagree or feel you had a different understanding than the \nitems below, please be sure to call me asap.\n1. Input HPLC purchase from HPLR Liquids at meter 8793 (HPL/HGPL).  Remove \nthe 3 Rivers gas from the Interconnect ticket and input on\n the Purchase Deal.\n2. Input HPLC sale to HPLR Liquids at meters 9643 (KGPL/HPL) and 12 \n(KGPL/HGPL).  Remove 3 rivers volumes from the interconnect tickets \n at these meters and input on the sales Deals appropriately.\n3. Change swing parameters for the King Ranch contracts to swing on Cage \nRanch before swinging on 3 Rivers Gas.  This will hopefully allow \n the sale for 3 Rivers gas to remain at one meter as much as possible.\nI will hopefully have all of these changes made by the end of the day, and \nhave all contracts repathed.  It is my understanding that we are implementing \nthese changes effective Feb. 1st.\nStella,  This may or may not effect repathing of the HPLC gas at meter 9643, \nbased on the swing parameters that you have been using.\nThank you."
