strategic direction of the company and our day-to-day global operations.

Jeff will assume the role at a time when the company is hitting on all=20

the job, and after 15 years as CEO of this great company, I=01,m ready for =

Our succession plan has been clear for some time.  This has afforded Jeff a=

me the freedom to combine our strengths toward building a company that=20

forward to furthering that relationship as Jeff expands his role.

There are no plans for any other changes in our management team nor broad=

shifts in strategy and direction.

Please join me in congratulating Jeff.  I look forward to a great 2001."

Hi Joe,
 
I'm actually out of town today visiting family.  I just wanted to let you know that Kathy is pretty up to date on where I stand with the west curves.  What little information I do have was only obtained Wednesday afternoon, so not to much has been entered in to the file.  It appears we have quotes from at least one broker for the following days: 12/12/01-12/21/01, 12/31/01, 01/02/12.  I have talked to a few people from west-risk who are trying to track down more information.  I will forward the emails with attachments which I have recieved to yourself and feel free to grab what I have printed out from my desk (all data is simply sitting in front of my keyboard).  I have printed out all the days we currently have and attached the sheet confirming which broker provided the information and on what day.  Hope this helps.
 
Thanks,
Susan
 
Please reply back and let me know if you recieved the information as I am having some difficulty with my email.

All, 

Attached is a spreadsheet of Enron's curve names for the West book.  We just need a quick status on the broker quotes you have and the ones still needed/missing.  Please review the curves against the broker data you have (including electronic files), and indicate any gaps.

Based on your reply, the Estate will purchase the missing data.  Please have this prepared by 12:00 tomorrow.

Subject: URGENT PLEASE READ ASAP
Importance: High

Greetings:
Yesterday at the ISO several of us were successful in communicating the need
for a more diverse ""Market Repair Team"" that would include perhaps some
additional members and a ""Stakeholder Advisory Committee"".  We were also
successful in communicating our cost-benefit analysis and delaying the
immediate adoption of the team. The motion (approved 5-0) read:

Board of Governors Market Repair Team
MOVED, that the Board approve the concept of a Market Repair Team along the
lines described in the Florio memorandum of March 14, 2001, and directs ISO
management to provide a response to the proposal addressing among other
issues, issues of cost/ benefit, conflicts of interest, team composition at
the next Board meeting.

IEP, CMUA, SMUD, and Grid Services were all asked to submit some proposed
names by today to the ISO Management, please see below e-mail from Elaina:

Today during the Public Comment, you all indicated that you might have names
as potential members of the Advisory Group for the Market Repair Team.  It
is not clear at this point how the whole process will be structured, but we
have been asked to put together a proposed game plan including names for
potential members of the Advisory Group.  Please send them to me ask quickly
as you can:  Friday pm is what Chairman Kahn asked for.

We would like to be as responsive as possible to the request and have
thought of the idea of proposing someone that EPSA uses in a variety of
roles.  CMUA will also probably be proposing someone from their national
organization.  The name that has been suggested for IEP to submit is Craig
Roach of Boston Pacific consulting who has done extensive work for EPSA in
supporting a competitive market policy. There is more information on Dr.
Roach and Boston Consulting on their web site www.bostonpacific.com.  I
spoke with Julie Simon at EPSA this morning and she also gave him an
enthusiastic endorsement.

Another idea or an additional person to submit  would be an economist that
is involved heavily in California.  Since both Hogan and Joskow have
financial ties to market participants we may want to consider proposing our
own economist.  It is the plan to submit both names to the ISO as well as a
letter addressing the following:


1. Raise very gently the issue of potential conflict of interest, coupled
with cost/benefit analysis etc
2. Address structural issues, including how stakeholders will participate.
3. Propose more diversity for the Market Repair Team,
4. Propose a Stakeholder Advisory Group as a third box, and include
stakeholders, including a regional perspective like neighboring control
areas, and folks with operational and market experience



It is crucial that if this plan sends up any red flags for you that you get
back to me ASAP.  I will be sending this letter to the ISO this afternoon
after we get the logistics worked out.  IF you have problems with this
direction please supply additional names we can route with the group.  I
have talked to a few companies that were at the meeting yesterday and they
are comfortable but wanted to make sure everyone had a say.

SIVY ON STOCKS from money.com
May 7, 2001

Higher Flyer

Top techs such as Nokia may not look cheap by traditional valuation
measures. But they may still be good buys.

By Michael Sivy

Value is a relative term. Every once in a while, you get a chance to buy
shares in a company with annual earnings growth of more than 20 percent at
a price/earnings ratio of 16 or less. But that doesn't happen very often.
Most of the time, conservative investors are lucky to find 14 percent
growth at a 16 P/E. Slightly more aggressive investors might be happy with
18 percent growers at P/Es in the low 20s. The most successful growth
stocks, however, may never fall all the way down to those cheap valuations.
But that doesn't mean you shouldn't buy them.

In fact, there are good reasons to devote at least a part of your portfolio
to those kinds of high flyers. For one thing, those companies are typically
among the world's most successful. In addition, they receive ongoing
support and sponsorship from Wall Street analysts. As long as they continue
to meet expectations, they will hold up fairly well in temporary market
downturns. And they will be among the first stocks to bounce back.

A perfect case in point looks to be Nokia [NOK]. The Finnish giant is the
most successful firm in one of the world's most rapidly growing industries.
And since 1997, Nokia's share of the global wireless-phone handset market
has risen from less than 20 percent to 35 percent, helping the company
nearly double earnings per share since 1998.

Of course, no company can increase its market share indefinitely, but there
are several factors that should help sustain Nokia's superior profit
growth. Since most everyone who would use a cell phone already has one, the
bulk of the sales of cell phones using existing technology is replacement
business. And when existing users switch phones, they tend to maintain
brand loyalty -- if they change providers at all, they migrate toward the
strongest one (say from Ericsson to Nokia, but not the other way around).
As a result, Nokia could gain another couple of market share points in
current-technology handsets.

Even more important, the company is capable of attaining a market share
topping 40 percent in the next generation of handsets -- both those that
use more sophisticated technology for voice transmission and those that
will provide paging, instant messaging, and Internet access. Overall, the
handset market is projected to grow at an annual compound rate of just
under 23 percent over the next four years. And with market share gains,
Nokia's sales should do even better.

In the past few quarters, the over-capacity problems that have plagued the
telecom industry have been hurting handset makers as well as service
providers. Not only has growth slowed -- total sales of cell phones were up
only 12 percent in the first quarter -- but the introduction of new
technology is being delayed. As a result, Nokia's earnings, up just 15
percent in the first quarter, will likely fall short of a 20 percent gain
for the year as a whole.

Once the current slump passes, however, Nokia's growth should recover to
nearly 25 percent a year. And so, despite a P/E of 40 based on estimated
earnings for the current year, the stock seems quite attractive. At $33,
Nokia is trading at just over half the level it was a year ago. And the
share price, which dipped as low as $21 a month ago, now appears to be in
an upswing. Even if the next couple of quarters show subpar results, Nokia
figures to be back among the market's brightest stars within 12 months.

Many Power Deals Announced By Calif Gov Still Not Final
By Jason Leopold
  
03/07/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 


OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

   
(This article was originally published Tuesday.)

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Many of the long-term power supply contracts 
announced by California Gov. Gray Davis this week remain under negotiation or 
are the subject of ongoing lawsuits, power suppliers said Tuesday. 


The lack of finality to the deals raises questions about the state's success 
in covering its power needs, particularly going into what is expected to be 
an unusually tight summer. 


Generators said privately they were surprised the governor went ahead with 
his announcement Monday, given that many of the contracts haven't been signed.


David Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power, who negotiated the contracts on behalf of the state, conceded that 
details remain to be worked out. 


""This is not a done deal,"" Freeman said, adding that credit concerns are 
keeping generators from signing the deals. 


Davis announced Monday that California has secured 40 long-term contracts 
that will provide California with about 629 million megawatt-hours of 
electricity over 10 years, at a price of more than $40 billion. 


Several of those forward deals, however, involve contracts originally held by 
Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp. 
(PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric at the California Power Exchange, 
previously the state's main power market. 


The governor seized those contracts earlier this year, just before the Power 
Exchange liquidated them to cover hundreds of millions of dollars in power 
bills the utilities had failed to pay. 


The contracts, which total about 1.3 million megawatt-hours of electricity 
and have a market value of about $1 billion, according to market sources, 
have yet to be paid for or signed over to the state. Duke Energy (DUK), one 
of the suppliers that sold the contracts to Pacific Gas & Electric and 
Southern California Edison, has sued Davis for unlawfully commandeering those 
contracts. 


Although Duke has reached an interim settlement to continue providing power 
to the state Department of Water Resources until April 30, the company and 
the Davis administration still have to ""develop a comprehensive long-term 
settlement to pay for the power supply contracts,"" said Duke spokesman Tom 
Williams. 


The governor went ahead with the announcement, because the California 
Department of Water Resources believes it will be able to finalize and sign 
the contracts over the next several weeks, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio 
said. 


Separately, several suppliers named in the governor's announcement Monday - 
including Duke, Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), Mirant Corp. (MIR), Sempra Energy 
(SRE), Enron Corp. (ENE) and Avista Corp. (AVA) - said they have yet to sign 
final agreements with the state, although negotiations were ongoing. 


""We are working in good faith with the DWR toward a long-term contract,"" said 
Art Larson, spokesman for Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra Energy 
(SRE). Larson said Sempra signed a terms of agreement with the DWR and 
expects to reach a final agreement over the next several weeks. 


Reliant Energy said it has only signed a short-term contract with the state 
that expires in about two weeks. The company will only sign a long-term 
contract once it's paid more than $400 million owed by Pacific Gas & Electric 
and Southern California Edison, spokesman Richard Wheatley said. 


Mirant Corp. said it also won't sign contracts with the state until it's 
paid. 


Enron said it's reached agreement on terms with the state, but has some 
credit-related details to hammer out. 


""Everything's been agreed to except for some credit technicalities,"" Enron

otherwise, the last one covers the trueup of negative values.  Do you

impresario (im-pruh-SAR-ee-o) noun

   1. An organizer, promoter, or manager of public entertainments, such as
      a ballet, opera, concert, or theater company.

   2. Any manager or director.

[From Italian impresario (one who undertakes a business), from impresa
(undertaking), from imprendere (to undertake).]

   ""Even on Broadway, few stars have crashed as spectacularly as Garth
   Drabinsky, the impresario behind Ragtime, theatreland's highest-grossing
   show.""
   From Riches to Ragtime, The Economist (London), Aug 15, 1998.

""All the world's a stage, / And the men and women merely players: / They
have their exits and their entrances; / And one man in his time plays
many parts."" So wrote our friend Bill Shakespeare some 400 years ago in
one of his most profound observations on human condition. Yet, we often
treat this life as if we really are the people we're playing. Imagine how
few troubles we might have if we remember it's only a role we are playing.
All we need to do is to play it as best we can and then gracefully exit
the stage.                                                         -Anu

Based on the conversation we had  at the meeting last Thursday, I am 
implementing the following changes to Humble Gas Pipeline and King Ranch Gas 
Plant.  If you disagree or feel you had a different understanding than the 
items below, please be sure to call me asap.

1. Input HPLC purchase from HPLR Liquids at meter 8793 (HPL/HGPL).  Remove 
the 3 Rivers gas from the Interconnect ticket and input on
 the Purchase Deal.

2. Input HPLC sale to HPLR Liquids at meters 9643 (KGPL/HPL) and 12 
(KGPL/HGPL).  Remove 3 rivers volumes from the interconnect tickets 
 at these meters and input on the sales Deals appropriately.

3. Change swing parameters for the King Ranch contracts to swing on Cage 
Ranch before swinging on 3 Rivers Gas.  This will hopefully allow 
 the sale for 3 Rivers gas to remain at one meter as much as possible.

I will hopefully have all of these changes made by the end of the day, and 
have all contracts repathed.  It is my understanding that we are implementing 
these changes effective Feb. 1st.

Stella,  This may or may not effect repathing of the HPLC gas at meter 9643, 
based on the swing parameters that you have been using.

Thank you."

                                       For a perfect mix of performance, sound and looks in a cat back exhaust system, this is it. Corsa's patented Power Pulse RSCTM (Reflective Sound Cancellation) technology uses sound waves to enhance the throaty LS1 power pulses and eliminate exhaust drone and interior resonance. The Touring Edition provides a crisp, exotic car sound with a whisper quiet cruise note. The Pace Car Edition has a broader, more aggressive tone at full throttle.  Exhaust systems are hand built of 316L stainless steel and feature a 2 1/2 straight through muffler design to increase flow 45% over the stock system.

Along with FREE SHIPPING, Zip Products has some great November specials on Corsa Exhaust Systems and Cross-Over Pipes.

NewPower to offer another pilot program to Houston employees


Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy 
bills.
NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500 
people to sign up in the Houston area.  The NewPower Connections Remote 
Energy Management Solution is a pilot program designed to give consumers 
control of their thermostat via the Internet.  The program will allow 
thermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, 
including computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket 
PCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy 
Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot 
program.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up 
to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and 
the size of your home.  


Be among the first to participate absolutely free.
Enrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution 
pilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month.  For 
more information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the 
Plaza of the Enron Building near the down escalator from 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
during the week of May 14.  To become a pilot participant you need only to be 
a homeowner in the Houston area and have Internet access.  You do not even 
have to be a NewPower electricity customer to participate.  For more 
information about NewPower Connections, send an e-mail to 
connections@newpower.com.

with respect to the NewPower program shall be solely between NewPower and

We all need to have a discussion around current California processes for both the business which is being processed for EPMI as well as the Services business we are providing to our customers.

I would like to walk through each process tomorrow and make sure that everyone understands their roles.

In addition, I feel that everyone needs to understand how to do the other persons job.  I know in some cases this will be harder for some than others.  Trying to understand all of the settlement processes is not something that I expect everyone to pick up. However,  I do expect everyone to know how the scheduling process works and if needed how they can back fill.

Primary area's to cover.

1.	Energy Forecasting
-	Wholesale
i.	Perf. Book only (Active Deals)
-	Retail 
i.	All Active Deals 

2.	Energy Procurement 
-	Wholesale 
-	Retail 

3.	Physical Scheduling DA, HA & RT Responsibilities
-	Basic process 
i.	Receive Daily Forecasts /  (Whole & Retail)
ii.	Create and Submit Aggregated Schedules as SC to ISO
iii.	Retrieve Final ISO schedules and dis-aggregate and check for variances
iv.	Manage variances & RT adjustments (CAPS, EnPower, Estate Sheet)
-	Tools Used
i.	Inputs
ii.	Outputs

4.	Daily Estimation process

5.	Daily Meter Data Submittal

6.	Daily Preliminary Settlement Statement Processing

7.	Daily Dispute Process

8.	Daily Final Settlement Statement Processing

9.	ISO Monthly estimated pre-payment
-	Calculation
-	ESS Settlement prepayment (EPMI Allocation?)

10.	Physical EPMI Settlement with Customers / Books
-	Commodity 
-	Grid Management / Market Transmission Transactions
-	External Customers
i.	ISO

kilkenny cats (kil-KEN-ee kats) noun

   People who fight relentlessly till their end.

[From a pair of proverbial cats in Kilkenny who fought till only their tails
were left.]

According to a story, some people in the town of Kilkenny in Ireland enjoyed
tying the tails of two cats and watching them fight till only their tales
were left behind. Most likely the story is a parable of a contest between
Kilkenny and Irishtown, two municipalities which fought about their boundaries
till little more than their tails were left. Here is a popular limerick
(another word that takes its origins from the name of an Irish town) about
the cats:

""There wanst was two cats of Kilkenny
Each cat thought there was one cat too many
So they fought and they fit
And they scratched and they bit
'Til instead of two cats there weren't any.""

   ""When Lord Cranborne placed Hatfield House at the disposal of Unionists
   to talk things through in November 1997, the result was a meeting after
   the style of the fighting Kilkenny cats.""
   A Man of Parts, The Economist (London), Apr 15, 2000.

The objective of this meeting on Tuesday is to review a systems drawing provided to us from ESCA.  We can make additions/modifications to the drawing to review with ESCA during our Wednesday meeting.  

I will send out the systems drawing by COB today.   

Please let me know if you have any questions/comments or you would like to add others to the meeting.  

Thank you.

Jason --

Attached are the documents with the changes incorporated.  As we discussed on
Friday, the plant maintenance will run into November.  Since we sold gas to 
the plant
at the maximum level through October 20th, a smaller resale volume or MW 
Turndown
will have to be used for the first week or so in November.  Also, I have 
tried to adjust
the formula so that you get the same answer as what your memo with the 
examples
indicate.  If there are a few more changes, please let me know.

I will be back in the office on Tuesday.

Ruth

Over the past several weeks, we have seen an increase in the number of 
""killed"" or modified EOL transactions.   Please remind each of your 
respective groups that this is not an option. Once a customer ""clicks"" on a 
deal, we have a valid, binding contract.   We lose our audit trail, and we 
can potentially expose ourselves from a Legal standpoint.   I talked to Mark 
Taylor about this today, and the best option is for Legal to prepare a 
termination agreement when we agree to let a customer out of a deal.  We 
(Product Control) should be notified immediately if someone is requesting to 
change an EOL deal.  You can call either myself, Jennifer Denny (x35824), 
Frank Davis (x37235), or Dale Neuner (39746). 

Call me if you have any questions.
